The repository got a makeover. Well, the content the webserver displays got a makeover. Instead of showing just a plain open directory, the visitors will now see a more good-looking HTML page with the list of the packages.

This change will have no impact on how you install the packages on your computers. That will remain as it always was: at a *pacman -Syu %package_name%* away.

To make it smooth on the eyes, I chose the Catppuccin colour scheme. This was the perfect excuse I was looking to use it. I find it vastly enjoyable to look at.

You can take a look at it on [Github](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) and, if you'd like, use it on any of the supported applications. Each one has its own dedicated repository.
